REST - Representational State Transfer

Uniform interface - If I call an API, use FS module to write a file (write.File). How would you read a file(read.File)?

Stateless - Any call to the server, isn't dependent on previous calls to the server.
  - When you make an API call, you're giving the server all the information it needs and returns back to the client, all it needs.
  - Doesn't matter which server it hits, it won't change what information you get back.
  - Send a token?, to keep the call stateless.
Keeps the database from the client

Cacheable???

Load balancer???

HTTP verbs --
get - used only to retrieve information from the database
post - creates a row
put- updates a row
delete - removes a row
